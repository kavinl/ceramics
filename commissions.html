            <h1>Commissions</h1>

            <p>I accept commissions for custom ceramic work. Each commissioned piece is made individually on the pottery wheel, following the same deliberate process as my other work.</p>

            <h2>What I Make</h2>
            <p>I work with functional forms—jars, lidded containers, vases, large objects, bowls and more. These are pieces meant to be used and displayed.</p>

            <p>Commissions can specify size, form, glaze choice, and clay body. I work with brown stoneware, white stoneware, Lizella clay, and occasionally porcelain. Glaze options include shino, floating blue, Alberta slip, and others depending on the desired cone temperature.</p>

            <h2>Timeline</h2>
            <p>The ceramic process is inherently slow. From the initial throwing to final firing, a commissioned piece typically takes 4-6 weeks. This accounts for drying time, bisque firing, glazing, and the final glaze firing schedule at Callonwalde in Atlanta.</p>

            <p>Rush orders aren't possible without risking the quality of the work.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>I love to work collaboratively with you to determine what is possible. Commission work begins with a conversation about what you're looking for—form, size, intended use, and aesthetic preferences. I'll provide input on what's feasible and how different clay bodies and glazes will affect the final piece.</p>

            <p>Once we agree on the direction, I'll send progress photos throughout the process. This allows for adjustments if needed. After the final firing, the completed work is ready for pickup or shipping.</p>

            <h2>Pricing</h2>
            <p>Pricing depends on size, complexity, clay body, and firing temperature. Cone 10 firings and lidded pieces require more time and planning, which affects cost. Contact me with details about what you're looking for, and I'll provide a quote.</p>

            <h2>Get Started</h2>
            <p>If you're interested in commissioning a piece, reach out via email with details about what you have in mind. Include preferred size, form, and any glaze or color preferences. I'll respond with questions and a timeline estimate.</p>
