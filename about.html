            <h1>About</h1>
            
            <p>I'm a ceramic artist based in [Your City], working with clay to create functional vessels and sculptural forms that explore the relationship between utility and beauty.</p>
            
            <p>My practice centers on [describe your approach - e.g., "hand-building techniques and the Japanese tradition of wabi-sabi" or "wheel-thrown forms with experimental glazing" or whatever is true to your work]. Each piece is made slowly and deliberately, shaped by the rhythm of the wheel and the unpredictability of fire.</p>
            
            <p>I studied at [Your Education/Training], and have been working with ceramics for [X] years. My work has been exhibited at [Galleries/Shows if applicable], and I maintain a small studio practice where I create both functional tableware and one-of-a-kind sculptural pieces.</p>
            
            <p>The ceramics I make are meant to be used and lived with. I'm interested in how objects can become part of daily rituals - the weight of a favorite mug, the curve of a bowl that fits perfectly in your hands.</p>
