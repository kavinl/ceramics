            <h1>The Making Process</h1>

            <h2>Wheel Throwing</h2>
            <p>Each piece begins on the pottery wheel. I use traditional wheel-throwing techniques to shape stoneware clay into functional vessels. The wheel allows for creating symmetrical forms with dynamic proportions—jars, pitchers, and lidded vessels that balance visual interest with practical use.</p>

            <h2>Trimming and Refinement</h2>
            <p>After the initial throwing, pieces are trimmed when leather-hard. This is where the final form takes shape. Foot rings are carved, walls are refined to optimal thickness, and handles are pulled and attached. Each pottery piece is carefully considered for both aesthetic and functional qualities.</p>

            <h2>Drying</h2>
            <p>Proper drying is essential to prevent cracking. Ceramic pieces dry slowly and evenly before bisque firing. This stage requires patience—rushing leads to structural problems that can't be corrected later.</p>

            <h2>Bisque Firing</h2>
            <p>The first firing transforms raw clay into ceramic. Bisque firing typically reaches Cone 04 (around 1940°F), making the pottery hard enough to handle while remaining porous enough to accept glaze.</p>

            <h2>Glazing</h2>
            <p>Glaze application is where color and surface come alive. I work with a range of glazes including shino, floating blue, and Alberta slip glazes. Each glaze responds differently to firing conditions, creating unique surfaces on the stoneware pieces.</p>

            <p>Glazing techniques vary—dipping, pouring, brushing—each chosen to complement the form. The chemistry of ceramic glazes means results are never perfectly predictable, which is part of the beauty of handmade pottery.</p>

            <h2>Glaze Firing</h2>
            <p>The final firing at Callonwalde in Atlanta brings everything together. Pieces are fired to Cone 6 or Cone 10 (2232°F to 2381°F) depending on the clay body and glaze. High-fire stoneware firing creates durable, functional pottery with rich, developed surfaces.</p>

            <p>The kiln atmosphere, heating rate, and cooling cycle all affect the final appearance. Each firing is an act of controlled transformation—clay and glaze fusing into finished ceramic work.</p>

            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>This process is slow by design. Each stage requires attention and craft knowledge built over time. The result is pottery meant to be used, lived with, and valued—functional ceramics that become part of daily life.</p>
